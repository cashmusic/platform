###Assets: add a release or file

What you'll need:

- A storage connection, we recommend Amazon S3

**Adding a new release**

Head on over to the **Assets** section and select **Add a new release**. You'll be asked to give it a title and a description—this is for your reference only. When you're done, click **Save changes**. Inside the release details page is where you can specify the artist name, release date, catalog number and begin attaching files for download.

To add fulfillment files to your release click **Attach a file**. You'll once again be asked to give it an internal name and description, and then asked which storage connection to use. Select your connection from the **Which storage connection?** dropdown menu and an upload button will appear. If you host the files on your own server, provide the location (URI). When you're done, click **Save changes**.To return to your release and continue adding files, click the arrow in the upper-left-hand corner.

When you're done adding files to your release, click **Save changes**.

**Tip**: All the files you attach to a given release will be made available as a group. For instance, if you're offering an album and attach 12 mp3 files and two artwork files, whoever accesses your release through one of our elements will have to individually download all fourteen files. Consider compressing all your files into a zip file.

**Uploading a file**

If you choose to add a file, you'll be prompted to give it a name and a description—this is for your reference only. If you've set up a Drive or S3 account, select it from the **Which storage connection?** dropdown menu and an upload button will appear to add your file. If you host the files on your own server, provide the location (URI). When you're done, click **Save changes**.

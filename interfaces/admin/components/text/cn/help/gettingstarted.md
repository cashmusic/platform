There's a lot in the CASH platform, and it helps to start with a few core concepts. 

First and foremost, look at the main menu and you'll see five main categories:  

  **Main page:** This is where you'll set up your elements and track their activity. You can also publish and edit your quick one page site here, get an embed code for any element you've set up, and organize all your projects. 
  
  **Assets:** Files, releases, and playlists. Basically anything you'll work on or use for 
   fulfillment somewhere else in the platform.

  **People:** Email and permission lists as well as press coverage. Right now this is mainly 
   for email lists, but this is where you'll see more social integration and tools for interacting 
   with people â€” from followers to writers and fans.

  **Commerce:** Review your orders, manage inventory, and set up new items to sell.

  **Calendar:** Shows and venues.


While you explore the platform remember that you can always click the learn icon <i class="icon icon-learn"></i> to see

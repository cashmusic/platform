###Download codes

What you'll need:  

- A storage connection--we recommend an Amazon S3 account for reliability
- An asset with attached fulfillment files (hosted on your storage connection)

On the **Assets** tab, click on the **Asset settings** below your chosen asset. Type in how many download codes you'd like, and hit **Add codes** to generate them. This is also where you can export your codes to an Excel/Google Docs compatible .csv file.

Now you'll need to make the redemption form so your fans can redeem their codes. Go back to the main page, click on the **Elements** tab, click on **Add an Element** and choose **Download Codes**. Give it a name for your own internal reference and edit the public success message.

The **Download Codes** element will work with any code you've generated for any of your assets. It knows to automatically give the correct asset to any valid codes. For this reason, make sure your success message doesn't reference a specific asset.

Finally, either add the element to your CASH Music page or embed the element on your own site.

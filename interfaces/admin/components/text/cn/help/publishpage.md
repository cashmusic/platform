###Publishing your CASH Music Page

What you'll need:

- An element or two set up and ready to go. 

Each platform user is given a free hosted, single page site on the CASH Music server. You can add as many different elements as you like to your page. 

To manage, edit, or publish your page simply click on the tab with its URL from the main page. Then click on **Start building a new page**. From there you can choose either a light or dark theme for your page and select **Create your page**. Once your theme is set then you may begin adding elements to your page. Simply click on the **Edit** tab. 

In the edit window, place your cursor after **id="mainspc"**. Then click the plus sign next to one of the elements you've already created to add that element to your page and hit **Save changes.** 

You can preview your page by clicking on the **View page** button. All of your elements will be live so you can test them out before you publish your page and send it out to fans. 

When you're ready to go live simply move the publish slider to the right. If you'd like to unpublish move it back to the left. Easy. 

You can edit/customize your page anytime and it will reflect those changes live.

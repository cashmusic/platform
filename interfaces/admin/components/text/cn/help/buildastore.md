###Build a store

You can watch a detailed video taking you through all of the steps to set up a store <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGE-2Og_pxM" target="_blank">here.</a>

What you'll need:

- A payment connection
- Any physical/digital items you wish to sell added to Commerce inventory

From the main page select the **Elements** tab. Click **Add an element** and select **Store**. Give the element a name for your own reference--no one else will see it.

Now, open the **Element settings** drawer below the store element you just created. Choose the style of store that you'd like to build. The default setting will be all your items in one column. **Two columns** is just as it sounds--side by side. **Compact** is a more compressed version of the two columns. You can try them all out once you've set the rest of the store up to see which one you prefer and can change it at any time.

Next, start adding the commerce items that you wish to sell. Now add all of the items you wish to include in this store. The order in which you select them will be how they are ordered in the cart as well. For example, the first item you add will be at the top, the second will be second, and so on. If you have a featured item, like a new release or shirt, that you'd like highlighted at the top of your cart, click on **Add a new featured item** and choose it from the dropdown menu.

Once you've finished that step, you can edit the messages that your customers will receive once they've placed their order.

Make sure when you're done that you click **save changes** at the bottom of the page.

Now you're ready to make your store live. You can either embed it on your own site or add to your CASH Music page and publish.

All incoming orders will show up in your **Commerce** section. You can also find details on every order, manage inventory, and export orders at any time there.

###Publishing your CASH Music page

Once you've added some elements and are ready to publish your page click the **edit icon**  <i class="icon icon-pencil"></i> and select **Page theme**. It'll prompt you to choose a light or dark theme for your page.

 Click on the campaign's **edit icon** again to open your page template. It includes an editor and some basic html code. If you're a novice and aren't sure what this code means, don't worry! We've made it really easy. Just look for a cat. There's an empty line after it. Click there.

All of your campaign elements are listed to the right of the template. Just click the **+** sign to embed the elements you'd like to publish on your page. You can also include any custom html or css you'd like. Once you're all done, click **Save changes**.

Now that you're back on your main page, scroll down until you see a box that says **Publish Settings**. Select your campaign from the drop-down menu, and when asked if you're sure about changing your public page, select **Yes, do it**.

You can go back and edit your campaign at any time, add new elements, change themes - you name it.  Also, if you want to unpublish your campaign, just scroll back down to **Publish settings** and select **None** from the dropdown menu.

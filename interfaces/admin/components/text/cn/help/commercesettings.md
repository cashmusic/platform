###Commerce Settings

Before you can sell anything through the platform you will need to set up your Commerce settings. 

Click **Commerce** in the main menu. If you haven't yet connected your payment options you'll need to do that now. Once those are set up, open **Commerce settings** and set your primary currency and select the PayPal and/or Stripe email addresses associated with your accounts from the dropdown menus. Once those are set up hit **Save sales settings.**

 Next select the **Shipping regions** tab. We give you two options for shipping. You can choose to set it up however you like but we suggest you select your home country (or the country where your merchandise is being shipped from) as Region 1 and the rest of the world as Region 2. Hit **Set shipping regions.**

 Now you're all ready to start adding items to sell!

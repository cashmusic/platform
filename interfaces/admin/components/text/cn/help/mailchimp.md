###Add a MailChimp connection

The CASH Music platform and MailChimp integrate seamlessly to directly add email sign-ups collected with our tools to your MailChimp account.

From the CASH Music platform, select the **gear icon** <i class="icon icon-cog"></i> from the upper-right-hand corner to open up your account settings. Click the **Connections** button, select the MailChimp button, and then click **Connect your MailChimp account**.

You'll be prompted for your MailChimp username and password. Once you click submit, you'll be brought to another page and asked which of your MailChimp mailing lists you'd like to sync your CASH account with. Once you've selected the appropriate list, click **Add the Connection**, and you're done!

If you have multiple mailing lists with MailChimp, you can keep creating new connections within CASH Music for each one. Just repeat the process, but select a different list at the last step.

Lastly, if you want to create a new list within MailChimp just for emails you retrieve via the platform, log into your your MailChimp account. Click **Lists** from the top menu, and click the **Create List** button in the top right-hand corner.

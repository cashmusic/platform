###Selling a physical item

What you'll need:

- A payment connection

To get started, head over to the **Commerce** section. Next, select **Inventory** from the sub menu. Click **Add an item**, and you'll be prompted to give a **public** name and description for the item as well as price, quantity, and whether or not there's a digital fulfillment file. Be sure to check the **Physical goods?** box, and then save your changes.

Once the item has been made click on the **edit** tab to add an image, select shipping prices, and add options if needed.

To add an image click on the **add/edit** image button on the left. It will prompt you to select your storage connection from a dropdown menu and upload the image you wish your customers to see. Hit the **Save changes** button when you're done.

To set the shipping prices open up the **Physical item options** section. Open **Show shipping region prices** and set the prices for purchasing one of these items as well as the second/or more price for both regions. Often it's much cheaper to send two of the same item so this is an option to give your customer a price break here. Hit **Save changes** again when you're done.

If you are selling anything with sizes or colors you'll need to add those here as well. Simply click **Show item options** and then enter in what you need. For example are you selling shirts with different sizes and colors? Then choose both size and color. Are you selling different colored mugs? Then just use color as the option. After you've added those you'll add inventory for each of them. Make sure and hit **Save changes** when you're done.

**Show item options** is also where you'll adjust or check inventory. The cart will NOT sell anything to your customers that's out of stock.

If this is the only thing you wish to sell, it's time to create a **Single Purchase** element. Head back over to the main page, select the **Elements** tab and click **Add an element**. Select **Single Purchase**. Choose the item you wish to sell from the dropdown menu and give it a name for your own reference. To edit the success/error message, click on the **Element settings** button.

Once the element is created and you're ready to go live, either embed it on your site or on your CASH Music page and publish.

If you included a digital fulfillment file with the purchase of your physical product, the confirmation page your customer sees will include download options. They will also receive an email receipt with a link to download as well.

All orders will show up in your **Commerce** section. You can also find details on every order, manage inventory, and export orders at any time there.

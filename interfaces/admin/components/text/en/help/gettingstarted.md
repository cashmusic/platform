There's a lot in the CASH platform, and it helps to start with a few core concepts. 

First and foremost, look at the main menu and you'll see five main categories:  

 - **Assets:** Files, releases, and playlists. Basically anything you'll work on or use for 
   fulfillment somewhere else in the platform.

 - **People:** Email and permission lists, contacts, and press coverage. Right now this is mainly 
   for email lists, but this is where you'll see more social integration and tools for interacting 
   with people â€” from followers to writers and fans.

 - **Commerce:** Review your orders and set up new items to sell.

 - **Calendar:** Shows and venues.

 - **Elements:** How you publish everything else to the outside world. Very much like the "widget"
   idea, elements are bundles for functionality you can publish to your site with a single line of 
   code.

While you explore the platform remember that you can always use the Help menu in the upper bar to see 
tips for the page you're on or to come back to this FAQ section. 

And hover over your email in the upper bar at any time to access system settings, edit your account,
or log out.

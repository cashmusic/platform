### Why Amazon S3?

An **Amazon S3** connection is used to store and access files for assets. We recommend it because it's secure, reliable, and fast. 

While it's a paid service, new users get one free year. After that, you still only pay for what you use. For most artists, it'll work out to mere pennies per month. You can learn more about their pricing <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Step by step

To set up a connection to S3 you first need to sign up for an Amazon Web Services account at 
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">aws.amazon.com</a>. After that you're just a few quick steps away from setting 
everything up. 

First, log into your Amazon Web Services account, click **My Account** in the upper-right-hand corner, and select **Security Credentials**. You'll be prompted to choose between security credentials and getting started with IAM Users. Select **Continue to Security Credentials**.

From the next page, click **Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)** to expand the section. From here, click **Create New Access Key**. You'll see a prompt. Click **Show Access Key** and copy both the access key and secret key. Then, click Download Key File before closing the prompt. Keep the file you just downloaded somewhere safe, since you'll need it if you ever want to view your secret access key again.

Now, head back to the CASH Music platform, and click the **gear icon** <i class="icon icon-cog"></i> in the upper-right-hand corner. Click the **Connections** button and select the **Amazon Web Services** button. You'll be asked for your access key and your secret key. After you've entered them, click **Add The Connection** and you're all set.

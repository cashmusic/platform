Once you’ve added your release info you can then generate and export download codes in the asset's settings. You don’t have to have a fulfillment file up yet to generate them which is handy if you're using them for LP's but make sure you’ve uploaded it, and made a corresponding download code redemption form element, before you start sending those codes out! Note: before you send the codes out to your fans always check one first. NEVER delete the asset associated with the download codeas as you will then invalidate all the codes. You can change files if need be but NEVER delete it, just upload another file. </p><p>You can always change any details - all linked commerce items and elements will automatically reflect the changes.</p>",

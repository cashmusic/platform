Dates are not live until you select a tour date element and then either publish your CASH Music page or embed the element on a web site.</p><p>However, if do you already have a live tour dates element you will automatically publish new dates when you add them here unless you uncheck the published box. So if you’re waiting to announce a show or tour make sure you uncheck published until it's time to announce so you don’t spill the beans.</p> ",

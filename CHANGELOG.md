    looks great. You love it. Thanks, Chris!
  - Added a full platform tour for new users, available from the help menu.
  - First-use help for the platform and all sections, teaching new users 
    how to get started and what to do next.
  - Reorganized and rewrote help section.
  - Rewrote all "learn" panels for pages.

    they need to set up and use an element, with helpful messages and links
    to next steps if not.
  - Simplified/improved element analytics.
  - New, more visual campaign interface.
  - Proceedurally generated campaign image to help recognition of the

## v.7 (October, 2014)

  - Chris took out all the dogs.
  - Reworked and greatly improved the interface.
  - Added the concept of campaigns to organize elements.

## v.6 (February 30, 2014)

  - Look I'm going to level with you. We skipped 6 entirely. That date
    is totally fake. Don't tell.

## v.5 (Maybe like November 2013)

  - Added in all the dogs and rainbows.
  - Multi-user.
  - Hosted version launched.
  - Seriously it was like 6 dogs with rainbows everywhere.
  - Platform architecture polished, final request/response format.
  - OAuth connections.

## v.4 (Early 2013)

  - I don't know. Maybe we fixed some bugs or whatever.

## v.3 (2012)

  - Some dinks sent us a cease and decist for the name "Seed" so in stubborn
    fashion we renamed things to "platform" and decided who cares about names
    because software names are all dumb. Seriously. Your phone OS is either 
    named "iOS" for "i Operating System" or "Android" because phones are 
    totally the same thing as humanoid robots and "Google" is the kind of 
    name you expect for a massive multinational company. See what I mean? 
    Who cares. You can tweet that or go find someone saying the same thing on
    "Bing" or "Yahoo!" or some shit. Any rate, we un-named it.

## v.2 (2011)

  - Version 2 made all the loose scripts work together in a kind-of/sort-of
    way. We named it "Seed" and came up with REALLY basic architecture.

## v.1 (Summer 2010)

  - Wasn't the Internet just AOL CD-ROMs in 2010? This was just like a heap 
    of code and probably a bunch of JPEGs.
